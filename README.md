Comparing Supervised and
Unsupervised GANs for the
Generative Modeling of Istanbul’s
Yalı Houses. 


This study investigates the generative
modeling of Istanbul’s historic yalı houses
using three approaches: Pix2Pix
(supervised), Self-Attention GAN
(unsupervised), and fine-tuned Stable
Diffusion (text-to-image). Trained on a
curated dataset of 1,646 images, the models
were evaluated using FID, SSIM, Inception
Score, and CLIP Score. Pix2PixHD showed
the best structural accuracy, while Stable
Diffusion achieved superior visual and
semantic results. The findings reveal distinct
strengths and limitations of each model in
architectural image synthesis.
